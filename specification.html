	<h2><span>1</span> The syntax of HSS</h2>
	<section class="introduction">
		<h3><span>1.1</span> Introduction</h3>
		<p>HSS stands for Hierarchical Style Sheets and it is the language used to instruct the AXR renderer how the various elements in the document should look like, how they are laid out and, to some extent, how they behave. The syntax of this language is inspired in CSS, but extending and altering it in various ways, to achieve powerful new ways of creating a web document. Therefore, HSS is not compatible with existing CSS files.</p>
		<p class="center"><img src="http://axr.vg/resources/axr/images/spec/hss_logo.jpg" alt="Hierarchical Style Sheets - Advanced UX Language" /></p>
		<p>HSS inherits the simplicity and clarity of CSSʼ syntax, but stops being a static language, bearing more similarity in some areas to other programming languages. The primary premise for this is the realization that a web page isnʼt a simple hyperlinked text document anymore, but an interactive software, which presents itself to the user through an interface and performs some logic, which may or not be displaying a text document. With this in mind, and the environment in which the document will be accessed (a computing device with an arbitrary display size), it is clear that some sort of interface programming language is needed which is able to express relationships and behaviors, and allows advanced interactivity and layout.</p><p>HSS files are plain-text files, and thus can be edited by any text editor on any platform, although some of its features are better put to use through a visual editing tool, since using code in those cases is less intuitive.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="primary_building_blocks">
		<h3><span>1.2</span> The primary building blocks</h3>
		<h4><span>1.2.1</span> Rules</h4>
			<p>One of the most basic concepts in HSS is the notion of rules. A rule is the combination of a selector and a block, which starts with an opening curly brace <code>{</code> and ends with a closing one <code>}</code>, and may contain property definitions and/or other rules.</p>			
<pre><span class="selector">selector</span>
{
	<span class="property">property definitions</span> ;
}</pre>

		<h4><span>1.2.2</span> Selectors</h4>
		<p>Selectors are used to point to a certain element(s) of the document, so that the properties defined inside of the block get applied to them. You define a search pattern and all applicable elements will be searched to see if their properties match the defined conditions. If so, the property definitions are applied.</p>
		<p>Simple selectors are the element name or universal selector, combined with any filter applied to it. A series of simple selectors joined by combinators is called the selector chain or simply selector.</p>
		<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre><span class="comment">//select elements with name “document”</span>
<span class="selector">document</span> { }
<span class="comment">//select the first element with name “book”</span>
<span class="selector">book</span><span class="filter">:first</span> { }
<span class="comment">//select the elements with name “content” that occur after “title”
//elements, which are descendants of “book” elements, which itself
//is a child of “books”</span>
<span class="selector">books book</span> <span class="combinator">..</span> <span class="selector">title</span> <span class="combinator">+</span><span class="combinator"></span> <span class="selector">content</span> { }</pre>

		<h4><span>1.2.3</span> Properties</h4>
		<p>Each element in the document has certain amount of properties, which you can define using property definitions. They are contained within the block that follows a selector chain.</p>
		<p>To write a property declaration simply place the name of the property, followed by a colon and optional whitespace, and then followed by a literal value, an expression, a function or an object. More whitespace can come afterwards, as well. If it is not the last property declaration of the block, it must be ended by a semicolon, to denote that it finishes on that place, and that what follows is something else.</p>
		<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><span class="selector">document</span>
{
    <span class="comment">//this makes it 150 points wide</span>
    <span class="property">width</span>: <span class="number">150</span>;
    <span class="comment">//this makes the element 10 points less high as its parent</span>
    <span class="property">height</span>: <span class="number">100%</span> - <span class="number">10</span>;
    <span class="comment">//this aligns the element to the center of its parent element</span>
    <span class="property">alignX</span>: <span class="number">50%</span>;
    <span class="property">alignY</span>: <span class="number">50%</span>;
}

<span class="comment">//in this example the semicolon was ommitted, since it is the
//last element in the block</span>
<span class="selector">document</span> { <span class="property">alignX</span>: <span class="number">50%</span> }</pre>

		<h4><span>1.2.4</span> Objects</h4>
		<p>Objects represent values that are more complex in their nature. Similar to rules, objects have properties which accept values, defined inside a block. Notice the object sign <code>@</code> in front of the object type;</p>
<pre><span class="selector">document</span>
{
    <span class="comment">//this makes the element have rounded corners</span>
    <span class="property">shape</span>: <span class="object">@roundedRect</span> {
        <span class="property">corners</span>: <span class="number">5</span>;
    };
    <span class="comment">//this adds a simple border, 3 points wide and black in color</span>
    <span class="property">border</span>: <span class="object">@lineBorder</span> {
        <span class="property">size</span>: <span class="number">3</span>;
        <span class="property">color</span>: <span class="number">#000</span>;
    };
}</pre>
	</section>
	
	<section class="selectors">
		<h3><span>1.3</span> Selectors</h3>
		<p>Consider the following XML snippet:</p>
<pre class="xml">&lt;<span class="selector">note</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span class="selector">to</span>&gt;Peter&lt;/<span class="selector">to</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span class="selector">from</span>&gt;James&lt;/<span class="selector">from</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span class="selector">subject</span>&gt;Reminder&lt;/<span class="selector">subject</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span class="selector">message</span>&gt;Please don’t forget to bring some &lt;<span class="selector">important</span>&gt;wine&lt;/<span class="selector">important</span>&gt;&#8230;&lt;/<span class="selector">message</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="selector">note</span>&gt;</pre>

		<p>In the following examples we will be using rules, but without property definitions for clarity.</p>
		<h4><span>1.3.1</span> A simple selector</h4>
		<p>You can target an element by its name. </p>
<pre><span class="comment">//match every note element (within the current scope) and apply
//the style rules declared within the block (in this case none)</span>
<span class="selector">note</span> { }</pre>

		<h4><span>1.3.2</span> Hierarchy</h4>
		<p>Usually what the HSS author does is following the document tree and applying styles to most elements. Rules can be nested inside another rules which will only match descendants of the elements matched by that other selector used by the set. This is what gives HSS its name.</p>
<pre><span class="comment">//match every note element (in the current scope)</span>
<span class="selector">note</span><br />{
	<span class="comment">//match every subject element which is a child of the
	//previously selected note element</span>
	<span class="selector">subject</span> { }
}</pre>

		<h4><span>1.3.3</span> Scope</h4>
		<p>The scope refers to what elements you are targeting by the selector. In the example above, only a subject element that is child of note can be selected, because its scope is restricted to the children of the note element.</p>
		<p>The scope is also reduced using combinators and expanded using grouping.</p>
		
		<h4><span>1.3.4</span> Grouping</h4>
		<p>You can group multiple selectors together, selecting more elements.</p>
<pre><span class="comment">//match every subject element and every message element</span>
<span class="selector">subject</span>, <span class="selector">message</span> { }</pre>

		<h4><span>1.3.5</span> The universal selector</h4>
		<p>The universal selector <span class="selector">*</span> matches every element in the current scope:</p>
<pre><span class="comment">//matches every element that is a child of &lsquo;note&rsquo;</span>
<span class="selector">note</span>
{
&#160;&#160;&#160; <span class="selector">*</span> { }
}</pre>

		<p><em>Note:</em> Since the initial scope is restricted to the root element, using simply the universal selector in the outermost rule set would only select the note element on the example XML code above, unlike what would happen in CSS. To select all elements that are descendants of another you need to use the descendant combinator, and to select all elements altogether you need to start the selector chain with the descendant combinator.</p>
<pre><span class="comment">//matches only the note element</span>
<span class="selector">*</span> { }
<span class="comment">//matches all elements, except the note element</span>
<span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">..</span> <span class="selector">*</span> { }
<span class="comment">//matches all elements</span>
<span class="combinator">..</span> <span class="selector">*</span> { }</pre>
#TODO the first time you encounter a combinator which wasn't already introduced: link it (internal anchor with title attribute)
<p>If the universal selector is not the only part of the selector, like when it has an attribute expression, property expression or a filter (all explained in further chapters), it can be omitted. It may be omitted as well if placed between any combinator other than the child combinator (whitespace), the closest descendants combinator <span class="combinator">.</span>&#160;and the descendants combinator <span class="combinator">..</span>. These are explained in further chapters as well.</p><pre><span class="comment">//the following statements are equivalent</span>
<span class="selector">*</span><span class="filter">:first</span> { }
<span class="filter">:first</span> { }
<span class="comment">//and so are these</span>
<span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span> { }
<span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span> { }</pre>
		
		<h4><span>1.3.6</span> Negating a selector</h4>
		<p>You can negate any selector by use of the negator <span class="combinator">!</span>, and any of its parts, in the selector chain, meaning that all elements that don’t match the selector will be selected. The name is negated by placing the negator in front of it.</p>
<pre><span class="comment">//this selects the elements which are not note</span>
		<span class="combinator">!</span><span class="selector">note</span> { }</pre><p>Any filter is negated by placing the negator in front of it. The filters are explained in a further chapter.</p><pre><span class="comment">//this selects any note element which is not the first one</span>
		<span class="selector">note</span><span class="combinator">!</span><span class="filter">:first</span> { }
		<span class="comment">//this selects any note element which is not the first one
		//and does not</span><span class="comment"> have a blue background</span>
		<span class="selector">note</span><span class="combinator">!</span><span class="filter">:first</span><span class="combinator">!</span>(<span class="property">background</span>.<span class="property">color</span> = blue) { }</pre><p>If you wanted to negate the entire selector, you place a negator in front of it, but leave a whitespace in between. Only elements in the scope of the last simple selector will be searched.</p><pre><span class="comment">//this matches all elements except the last note</span>
		<span class="combinator">!</span> <span class="selector">note</span><span class="filter">:last</span> {}</pre>
		
		<p class="notice"><strong>FIXME</strong> the syntax for selecting the entire selector is not optimal, I think. <a href="https://github.com/AXR/Specification/issues/4">Issue #4</a></p>

<span class="number">1.4</span> Combinators</h2><div class="inner">
<p>Combinators allow you to select an element based on its relationship to another in the hierarchy. Multiple simple selectors can be chained together, forming the selector chain. Usually this is done when you want to “skip” an element and style one that is inside it instead. It is more convenient to use a combinator than to use hierarchy, in the case of child combinators. In other cases, the combinator is needed because with hierarchy alone the same effect could not be achieved.</p><pre><span class="comment">//matches every subject element which is a child of message,
//which itself is a child of note</span>
<span class="selector">note</span> <span class="selector">message</span> <span class="selector">subject</span> { }</pre><p>Keep in mind that these examples only select elements in the current scope, and therefore will select elements depending on where in the hierarchy you are using them.</p></div></div><div class="view text section">

    &lt;<span class="selector">paragraph</span>&gt;This is a line of dummy text. Lorem ipsum <br>dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.&lt;/<span class="selector">paragraph</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="selector">document</span>&gt;</pre><p>First, we have to understand what happens with the content text when it is rendered. An element is represented by a container, think of it as an amount of space in the rendered document and inside it the content text and the containing elements. The default height of the container is the height of its content.</p><p>This is explained in more detail in the chapters about containers and display objects.</p><p>When the width of the container is not wide enough to accommodate all its content text, wrapping occurs. This means that the text is split in various lines of text, and therefore the height increases. Now there are two or more blocks stacked over each other.</p><p>Conceptually, the text can be further split into elements. Each word is preceded, followed, or surrounded by whitespace. Furthermore, each letter or symbol of that word is a separate glyph you can refer to.</p><p><img alt="Graphic explaining the concept of lines, words and glyps" src="http://axr.vg/resources/axr/images/spec/accessing_content_text.png"></p><p>To select portions of text, the content text combinator is used. This is a special combinator which has a distinct behavior, that’s why it is not listed among the other combinators. After the combinator, you write a string to specify what part of the text you want to select, or an empty string to select the entire content text.</p><p>You select a portion of the text using a string:</p><pre><span class="comment">//this will select any occurrence of “dummy text” and set
//it be 15 points tall</span>
<span class="combinator">..</span> <span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="string">“dummy text”</span> { <span class="property">height</span>: <span class="number">15</span> }</pre><p>The entire content text is selected if you use the universal selector (actually just selects all lines):</p><pre><span class="comment">//this will select the entire content text of the snippet element</span>
<span class="selector">document</span> <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span> { }</pre><p>You can also select elements by its type. This selects content text elements regardless of what characters actually are contained, and allows you to access any line, word or glyph.</p><p>To access a line, the universal selector is used after the content text combinator as well, but you filter them to point to that particular line:</p><pre><span class="comment">//this will select the first line of text</span>
<span class="selector">document</span> <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span><span class="filter">:first</span> {}</pre><p>In the case you want to select each line, broken up in individual elements, the each filter is used (explained below):</p><pre><span class="comment">//this will select the each line of text and give it vertical margin,
//increasing the line spacing</span>
<span class="selector">document</span> <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span><span class="filter">:each</span> { <span class="property">margin</span>: <span class="number">5</span> top, <span class="number">5</span> bottom }</pre><p>To access a word, you use the content text combinator and universal selector again, after selecting a portion of the text:</p><pre><span class="selector">document</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">//this will select the last word of the content text</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span><span class="filter">:last</span> { }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">//this is equivalent, since the universal selector can be
    //omitted if followed by another combinator, or if not the
    //only part of the simple selector</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="filter">:first</span> { }
}</pre><p>You repeat the same pattern again to select a glyph:</p><pre><span class="selector">document</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">//this will select the first letter of the content text</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="selector">*</span><span class="filter">:first</span> { }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">//this is equivalent</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="filter">:first</span> { }
}</pre><p>What actually happens when you select a portion of the content text is that a inline element is created, by the use of style rules. If the selected text is adjacent, this inline element spans across all the selected text, creating one addressable container per selection, unless the each filter is used. In that case, or when the selected portions of the text are not contiguous, one inline element is created per matching text element.</p><pre><span class="selector">document</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">//this will create one pseudo-element for the first three
    //lines of text</span>
    <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="filter">:range</span>(<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">3</span>) { }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">//this will create three pseudo-elements, one for each line</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="filter">:range</span>(<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">3</span>)<span class="filter">:each</span> { }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">//there is no need for the each filter on this one, since
    //the lines aren’t adjacent</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="selector">paragraph</span> <span class="combinator">&gt;</span> <span class="filter">:odd</span> { }
}</pre><p>These inline elements are very flexible and they can potentially intersect with each other, depending on the styles that are applied to different selections. So, for example, selecting the string <span class="string">“dummy text. Lorem”</span>, giving it some styles, and then selecting <span class="string">“Lorem ipsum”</span>, and applying styles, would result in three separate blocks: one with content <span class="string">“dummy text. “</span> (notice the whitespace), one with content <br><span class="string">“ ipsum”</span> (also with whitespace), and a third one, with content <span class="string">“Lorem”</span>, whose styles are a mix of the first and second one, with the styles of the rule that has been applied last overriding the first one. If anywhere inside of one of the inline&nbsp; elements text wrapping occurs, it is split into two inline elements, both with the same style.<br>

<span class="number">1.5</span> Filters</h2><div class="inner">
<p>Filters are used to reduce or alter the current selection. Each individual element of the selection is checked to see if the condition(s) match.</p><p>Always remember that if used alone, actually you are using the omitted universal selector. Filters can be appended to any other selector and even multiple filters can be added. For example, to you could do the following:</p><pre><span class="comment">//this matches the first occurrence of the note element,
//if it has a child</span>
<span class="selector">note</span><span class="filter">:first:parent</span> { }</pre><p>Keep in mind that the order of the filters will alter the outcome, so if you put the filters of the previous example in reverse order, it will select the <em>first element that has a child</em>, instead of the <em>first element, but only if it has a child</em>.</p><pre><span class="comment">//this matches the first of the note elements that have a child</span>
