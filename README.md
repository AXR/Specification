The AXR Project
===============
The AXR Project is a revolutionary open source project that will fundamentally improve our tools to create web sites and apps.

It's much in the style of current web standards, using plain text files linked together to create the final site, but with a complete separation of content and presentation, where the content is pure semantic data written in XML, and the presentation and behavior layer is written in HSS, a new language based on CSS, but with many powerful features, such as hierarchical notation, object orientation, modularization for code reuse, expressions (math), vector graphics, references (bindings between objects), and a very long etc.

Specification
=============
This repository is the place where we edit the current [working draft](http://spec.axr.vg/specification.html) of the specification of the HSS language.

Workflow
========
We hold a [meeting](http://axr.vg/wiki/Spec_Meetings) on our [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/axr) once a week, and the issues are also often discussed in the comments of the [github issues](https://github.com/AXR/Specification/issues).

Repository manager
==================
This repository is managed by the current drafter (@Mouvedia), however, he may not be available at all times, feel free to contact @veosotano (veosotano@gmail.com) instead. Please read through the entire readme before contacting him, since this may answer your question.
